Temporary Repository for a FreeBSD project: converting the "Getting
Started with the FreeBSD Documentation and Translation Projects"
document into FreeBSD's xml/docbook format. The goal is for this
document to be added to the FreeBSD website as a chapter of the
"FreeBSD Documentation Primer"
(https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/fdp-primer/),
though this is subject to change based on FreeBSD contributor input.


NOTE: When I remember, I'm trying to use the issues tracker as a
"TODO" list. Feel free to add or close issues. :)

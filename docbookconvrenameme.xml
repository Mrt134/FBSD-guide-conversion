    <title>Introduction to the &os; Documentation Project</title>

    <para>The &os; Documentation Project (<acronym>FDP</acronym>)
      maintains the documentation for the &os; project.  Its purpose
      is to provide &os; users with instructions for configuring and
      using the features provided by the &os; operating system.  It is
      intended for new users who have little to no experience with a
      Unix-like system and users who want to learn more about the &os;
      operating system.</para>

    <para>The &os; documentation set includes a number of documents of
      different types.  Some of the most important ones are described
      here:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para><emphasis>The &os; Handbook:</emphasis> A resource for
	  users to learn about the features this operating system
	  provides.  Its main focus is towards users administrators of
	  &os; systems.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><emphasis><acronym>FAQ</acronym>:</emphasis> A
	  collection of frequently asked questions and their answers.
	  This resource provides users with a written source of
	  consistently maintained answers.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><emphasis>Manual pages:</emphasis> There are the manual
	  pages provided with the operating system using the
	  <citerefentry><refentrytitle>man</refentrytitle>
	    <manvolnum>1</manvolnum>
	  </citerefentry> format.  In &os;, manual pages are managed
	  outside the <emphasis>doc</emphasis> repository, as they
	  reside within the <emphasis>src</emphasis> repository.

      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><emphasis>Articles:</emphasis> The &os; Project
	  maintains a collection of smaller articles.  These describe
	  certain things that do not fit into other documentation
	  categories, but are worth keeping around, sometimes for
	  historical reasons.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><emphasis>Books:</emphasis></para> This category
	  includes the Porter's Handbook, with instructions on how to
	  work with the ports system as a developer or
	  <emphasis>ports</emphasis> committer.  It also has the &os;
	  Developer's Handbook, intended for people who want to know
	  more about how &os; is developed and how some of its
	  subsystems work.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><emphasis>The &os; Website:</emphasis> The &os; Website
	  is maintained by the Documentation Project and can be built
	  like any other document using a
	  <filename>Makefile</filename>.<para>
      </listitem
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>The <acronym>FDP</acronym> also maintains the
      <link
	xlink:href="&url.base;/doc/en_us.ISO8859-1/books/fdp-primer/">FDP Primer</link>,
      which contains instructions for people who want to get involved
      in the &os; documentation project.  Starting from the tools
      being used, to formatting and indentation rules, it covers
      everything a person involved in &os; documentation needs to
      know.  It is used as a reference even by documentation
      committers who have been around for a long time.</para>

    <para>Translation projects for various countries and languages
      exist to translate &os; documentation into their respective
      languages.  Translated documentation helps users who do not
      speak English and who find it easier to understand the system
      when the instructions are written in their native
      language.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 xml:id="getstartedguide-tools">
    <title>Get the Tools</title>

    <para>The <acronym>FDP</acronym> maintains the
      <filename>textproc/docproj</filename> meta-port. This provides
      the software needed to edit and build the &os; documentation.
      To save compilation time, we will install this software using
      the package.  As the default package does not include
      Japanese (<acronym>CJK</acronym>) support, translation tools, or
      a translation file editor, we will also install those
      packages.</para>

    <note>
      <para>Although manual editing of a <filetype>.po</filetype>
	(translation) file is possible, using a PO editor provides
	more comfort and error checking. We will use
	<application>PO edit</application> in this workshop, which is
	available from
	<link xlink:href="https://poedit.net"></link>.</para>
    </note>

    <para>To begin the package installations, become the superuser and
      type
	<screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>pkg install textproc/docproj</userinput></screen>
      Whenever prompted, type <keycap>y</keycap> to proceed.
      Based on which dependencies are already installed on your
      system, this package installation may take a few minutes, so
      wait until it is finished.</para>

    <para>Next, install the following packages.  Again, type
      <keycap>y</keycap> when prompted.  If you receive a message
      indicating a package is already installed, skip that package and
      proceed to the next package installation.</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>pkg install textproc/html2text</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>pkg install japanese/font-ipa</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>pkg install textproc/itstool</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>pkg install editors/poedit</userinput></screen>

    <para>Once all the package installations are complete, leave the
      superuser account and type <command>rehash</rehash> to load the
      new binaries into your path.  You are now ready to move on to
      the next section to install the documentation source
      code.</para>

  </sect1>

  <sect1 xml:id="getstartedguide-source">
    <title>Get the Source</title>

    <para>Most of the &os; documentation, in all of the translated
      languages, lives in the doc repository.  This includes the &os;
      articles, the various handbooks, the <acronym>FAQ</acronym>, and
      the website, but not the manual pages as those are included in
      the base repository as part of the command being
      documented.</para>

    <para>In order to edit existing documentation, add new
      documentation, or translate documentation, you need to maintain
      a copy of that doc repository on your system and ensure it is
      kept synchronized with the official &os; repository.</para>

    <para>Before downloading the doc repository, decide where on your
      computer to store the local copy of the repository.  Since you
      will be using your regular user account when making doc changes,
      the location is typically somewhere in your home directory.  The
      first time you download the repository, it will be saved to your
      current working directory unless you specify where to save it.
      In this document, a subdirectory named
      <filename>freebsddoc</filename> is created a used as the
      location for downloading the repository.</para>

    <para>Ensure you are logged in as your regular user account and in
      your home directory before running these commands:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>svnlite co https://svn.freebsd.org/doc/head ~/freebsddoc</userinput></screen>

    <para>It will take a few minutes to complete the download.  Note
      you only need to use the <command>svnlite co</command> (short
      for <command>checkout</command>) command once, for the initial
      download.  However, you should <emphasis>always</emphasis>
      verify you are synchronized with the repository
      <emphasis>before</emphasis> you start to make any doc changes.
      To check for any changes and to synchronize with the repository,
      run the <command>up</command> from within the directory to which
      you downloaded the repository.  In this document, it appears
      like this:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>cd ~/freebsddoc</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>svnlite up</userinput>
Updating '.':
At revision 48138</screen>

    <para>In this example, no changes have been downloaded since none
      have occurred since you last downloaded the repository.  If
      there had been changes, you would see something like
      this:</para>

    <screen>Updating '.':
U    zh_TW.UTF-8/books/porters-handbook/Makefile
U    zh_TW.UTF-8/books/parters-handbook/book.xml
At revision 48138.</screen>

    <para>In this example, there have been two updates (U) to the
      Chinese translation of the Porter's Handbook.  It is important
      to note the names of the files that have changed if you are
      making edits to those same files and have not yet submitted your
      changes for review.  You should also make note of the revision
      number as this may be needed during the translation
      process.</para>

  <sect1 xml:id="getstartedguide-accounts">
    <title>Create Accounts</title>

    <para>Now that you have the necessary software and the
      documentation source, you should create a user account on the
      bug tracker and the review website.  You will need to be logged
      into the bug tracker in order to submit a patch and you will
      need to be logged into the review website in order to request a
      review of the patch.  It is also recommended to join the doc
      mailing list and, if you plan to assist with translations, the
      translations mailing list.</para>

    <sect2 xml:id="getstartedguide-bug-tracker">
      <title>Bug Tracker</title>

      <para>To create an account on the bug tracker, go to <link

    <title>Creating a Patch for Submission</title>
    
    <para>When the translation is finished, create a patch and 
      submit it to the FreeBSD project so that it becomes part of
      the official documentation set.  Start by adding 
      <literal>#$FreeBSD$</literal> as the 
      <emphasis>first line</emphasis> of the PO document.

    <para>This will later be replaced by the version control system 
      with a date timestamp and author information so that other
      people know when this file was last changed.</para>

    <para>Next, add the <filename>.po file</filename>, the 
      <filename>Makefile</filename>, and the translated
      <filename>article.xml</filename> to version control as part of
      the patch:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>% cd ~/doc/fr_FR.ISO8859-1/
      articles/leap-seconds/</userinput>
      &prompt.user; <userinput>% svnlite add Makefile 
      article.xml fr_FR.po</userinput>
      A         Makefile
      A         article.xml
      A         fr_FR.po</screen>

    <para>Set these properties on those files:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>% svnlite propset 
      svn:keywords FreeBSD=%H Makefile article.xml fr_FR.po
      </userinput>
      property 'svn:keywords' set on 'Makefile'
      property 'svn:keywords' set on 'article.xml'
      property 'svn:keywords' set on 'fr_FR.po'</screen>

    <para>Next, set the proper MIME types for the files. Usually, 
      this is the UTF-8 character set, but check for your local
      language encoding.  To prevent the version control system from
      mistaking these files as binary data, the <literal>
      fbsd:notbinary</literal>property must also be set:</para>

      <screen> &prompt.user; <userinput>% svnlite propset 
      svn:mime-type \'text/x-gettext-translation; charset=UTF-8' 
      fr_FR.po </userinput>
      property 'svn:mime-type' set on 'fr_FR.po'
      &prompt.user; <userinput>% svnlite propset fbsd:notbinary yes 
      fr_FR.po</userinput>
      property 'fbsd:notbinary' set on 'fr_FR.po'
      &prompt.user; <userinput>% svnlite propset svn:mime-type 'text/
      xml; charset=UTF-8' article.xml</userinput>
      property 'svn:mime-type' set on 'article.xml'
      &prompt.user; <userinput>% svnlite propset fbsd:notbinary yes 
      article.xml</userinput>
      property 'fbsd:notbinary' set on 'article.xml'</screen>

    <para>Since the <filename>Makefile</filename> is properly 
      recognized, there is no need to add the MIME types for this 
      file.</para>

    <para>Finally, the patch is created <emphasis>from the top-level 
      directory:</emphasis></para>

      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>% cd ~/doc
      % svnlite diff fr_FR.ISO8859-1/articles/leap-seconds \
      > /tmp/fr_FR-leap-seconds.diff</userinput></screen>

    <para>The patch file in 
      <filename>/tmp/fr_FR-leap-seconds.diff</filename>contains all 
      the information to generate the translated document and can be 
      submitted using the FreeBSD bug tracker.</para>

    <para>The &os; Project is committed to 
      maintaining high quality documentation and translations.  
      The tools and processes are constantly evolving to make it 
      easier for those who wish to help with the documentation 
      project.</para>
      
    <para>This section describes some of the tools that are 
      currently under consideration and testing for possible 
      integration into the documentation or translation workflow.  During BSDCan, drop by the Doc Lounge room in the evenings 
      for further discussion and demonstrations of these tools.    
      After BSDCan, discussion and status reports on these and 
      other tools will be available on the &a.doc or the 
      EFnet #bsddocs <acronym>IRC</acronym> channel.</para>

          This makes it easy for people to 
          review a document and make suggestions for 
          corrections or improvements.  This year, the

          >Weblate</link> are open source web-based PO translation
          systems that allow translators to use their web browser as
          a PO editor.  These systems share translation memory 
          between translators and can be configured to automatically
          commit translated strings for easy updates of translated
